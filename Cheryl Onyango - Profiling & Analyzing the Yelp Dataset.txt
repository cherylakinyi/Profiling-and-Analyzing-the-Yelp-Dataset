Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 1000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id 10000 (PRIMARY KEY)
ii. Hours = business_id 1562 (FOREIGN KEY)
iii. Category = business_id 2643 (FOREIGN KEY)
iv. Attribute = business_id 1115 (FOREIGN KEY)
v. Review = id 10000 (PRIMARY KEY), business_id 8090 and user_id 9581 (FOREIGN KEYS)
vi. Checkin = business_id 493 (FOREIGN KEY)
vii. Photo = id 10000 (PRIMARY KEY), business_id 6493 (FOREIGN KEY)
viii. Tip = user_id 537 and business_id 3979 (FOREIGN KEYS)
ix. User = id 10000 (PRIMARY KEY)
x. Friend = user_id 11 (FOREIGN KEY)
xi. Elite_years = user_id 2780 (FOREIGN KEY)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	Answer:
	Yes, there are more reviews with the word 'love' than the word 'hate' in them. 
	There are 1780 reviews with the word 'love' and 232 reviews with the word 'hate'.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(text) AS love_in_reviews

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

I used 'Charlotte' for city and 'shopping' for category. Yes, the two groups have different distribution of hours. The shopping center with the highest rating (4.0) is open on Saturday between 12pm to 11pm and the lowest rating (3.5) in comparision is open between 10am to 3pm on Saturday.

SELECT city, stars, hours, category
FROM business
INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
INNER JOIN hours ON category.business_id  = hours.business_id
WHERE category = 'Shopping' AND city = 'Charlotte'
GROUP BY stars

+-----------+-------+----------------------+----------+
| city      | stars | hours                | category |
+-----------+-------+----------------------+----------+
| Charlotte |   3.5 | Saturday|10:00-15:00 | Shopping |
| Charlotte |   4.0 | Saturday|12:00-22:00 | Shopping |
+-----------+-------+----------------------+----------+


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
Yes, they have differnt number of reviews. The 4 star has 5 reviews and the 3.5 star has 6 reviews.

SELECT city, stars, review_count, hours, category
FROM business
INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
INNER JOIN hours ON category.business_id  = hours.business_id
WHERE category = 'Shopping' AND city = 'Charlotte'
GROUP BY stars


+-----------+-------+--------------+----------------------+----------+
| city      | stars | review_count | hours                | category |
+-----------+-------+--------------+----------------------+----------+
| Charlotte |   3.5 |            6 | Saturday|10:00-15:00 | Shopping |
| Charlotte |   4.0 |            5 | Saturday|12:00-22:00 | Shopping |
+-----------+-------+--------------+----------------------+----------+
    
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

The addresses and post codes are different between these two groups though the city is the same, Charlotte.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT address, city, state, postal_code, stars, review_count, hours
FROM business
INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
INNER JOIN hours ON category.business_id  = hours.business_id
WHERE category = 'Shopping' AND city = 'Charlotte'
GROUP BY stars
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The ones that are open have a higher review count (2501) in comparison to the ones that are not open (564).  
Restaurants that open between 6pm to 11pm on Saturdays have more reviews.       
         
ii. Difference 2:
The ones that are open are rated higher - 4 star in comparison to the ones that are not open - 3 star.         
Restaurants that open between 6pm to 11pm on Saturdays are rated higher (4 star).    
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT city, stars, hours, category, COUNT(review_count), is_open
FROM business
INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
INNER JOIN hours ON category.business_id  = hours.business_id
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY review_count	

	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I did an analysis to assess the relationship between star ratings and reviews for open businesses.     
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I choose to use data from the business, category and hours tables. I wanted to showcase the city, stars, hours, category, review count and is open columns.
This data shows the businesses that are open in different cities and their star ratings as well as the number of reviews.                         
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

There is no correlation between the star rating and number of reviews businesses that are open. 
As shown in the output, the cities with the highest star rating of 5.0 have 4 or 5 reviews, a very low number considering they received a 5 star rating.
        
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT city, stars, hours, category, review_count, is_open
FROM business
INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
INNER JOIN hours ON category.business_id  = hours.business_id
GROUP BY city
HAVING is_open = 1
ORDER BY stars DESC
